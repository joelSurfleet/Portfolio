These are some projects in python, and MATLAB that showcase my skills

SurfleetToolbox.py is the python toolbox I wrote for equations I use in Aero 303 Gas Dynamics and Heat Transfer.
  -It can be seen in use in the reposity Gas Dynamics HW3 on my profile
  ThetaMachBeta is data used by this ToolBox

TheFinal.m is a MATLAB script written to complete the AERO 351 Orbital Mechanics file
  -The associated PDF: TheFinal.pdf shows it's output

Ansys Mdot read.py is a python program I wrote to read a large amount of ansys reports, perform analysis on them, and export them to an excel spreadsheet
  -The data gathered by this was used in a CDR for Cal Poly Space Systems

The folder CFD has some screenshots of the CPSS injector that I ran to investigate the mass flow rate between the holes and calculate the plume length.

The folder Aero 355 Midterm has the code I used to answer the questions on a midterm for my space environments class.

The folder MGA has a tool to calculate the mass growth allowance of a sattelite based on the design maturity of its subsystems
